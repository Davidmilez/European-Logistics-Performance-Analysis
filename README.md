# European Logistics Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end supply chain analytics solution designed to evaluate logistics performance across shipments, warehouses, carriers, and delivery routes.

The analysis focuses on identifying operational bottlenecks, improving delivery reliability, and supporting data-driven decision making.

---

## Business Objectives
- Monitor shipment delivery performance
- Identify high-delay routes and operational bottlenecks
- Evaluate carrier reliability
- Analyze warehouse operational efficiency
- Track priority order performance
- Investigate order splitting patterns

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Excel → Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling
- SQL Server → KPI calculations and analytical queries
- Power BI → Dashboard visualization and business reporting

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:

- Customers
- Products
- Orders and Order Items
- Shipments
